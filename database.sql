INSERT INTO `news` VALUES (1,'2023 BMW iX Review: The beauty is on the inside','JOEL STOCKSDALE','Great performance, space and an gorgeous interior make for an excellent flagship SUV','Pros: Exquisite interior design, superb performance, long electric range, comfortable rideCons: Polarizing exterior styling, no third row of seats, desirable driving assists are options. The 2023 BMW iX SUV is leading its brand’s latest wave of electric cars. It makes a statement anywhere it goes with its controversial exterior design, but get past that, and you\'ll discover a beautifully crafted luxury SUV that\'s comfortable to cruise in and surprisingly engaging when driven hard. The interior is where the iX really shines, with modern, airy design that\'s unlike anything on the market, let alone the BMW line-up. It also has the best implementation of the brand\'s current infotainment system, showcasing how good the system can be, when it\'s running well. It\'s also extremely spacious for occupants and cargo, in particular with more carrying space than its closest competitors, and just shy of the Tesla Model X. The ride quality is among the best available from BMW, and extremely good against the competition. It favors the firm side, but that, along with reasonably good steering and a talkative chassis make it fun to drive. The extra power of the iX M60 only adds to the fun. And with ranges exceeding 300 miles on the regular xDrive50 models, you can have fun driving it for long periods of time without having to stop for a charge. Its only major drawbacks are the aforementioned odd styling, a lack of a third-row seat option (although Tesla\'s and Mercedes’ are of questionable use), as well as hiding many features behind options. In particular, simple adaptive cruise control is an extra-cost option, which is somewhat galling when it\'s becoming commonplace on far more affordable cars.But all-in-all, the iX is a luxury electric crossover that feels genuinely special and practical, particularly for the price. If you\'re in the market, it\'s a must-see.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img'),(2,'2023 BMW M2 gets full range of M Performance parts','RONAN GLON','The catalog includes body kits, wheels, and suspension parts','Unveiled in October 2022, the new 2023 BMW M2 is already eligible to receive a wide selection of factory-developed M Performance parts. The list of add-ons announced by the Munich-based carmaker includes carbon fiber trim, forged wheels, and a lighter exhaust system. BMW M leveraged its five decades of racing experience to give future M2 owners numerous customization options. Starting with the outside, the company designed a carbon fiber body kit that includes a front splitter, inserts for the front air intakes, side skirts, a rear spoiler, and a rear diffuser. M Performance titanium and carbon fiber exhaust tips and a red M-branded tow strap add a finishing touch to the look. Speaking of the exhaust, BMW M created a system that consists of stainless-steel front pipes and a titanium rear section. It weighs over 17 pounds less than the stock setup and includes electronically-controlled flaps. BMW promises it unlocks \"distinct, racing car acoustics.\" Handling is one of BMW M\'s claims to fame, and the M Performance suspension system was designed to make the new M2 even sharper to drive on and off the track. It adds height-adjustable spring cups to the front and rear axles that let drivers lower the ride height by nearly half an inch. These parts can be paired with 20-inch front and 21-inch rear forged wheels available in M Frozen Gold Bronze or M Jet Black. Buyers who want an M-themed interior can add carbon fiber and Alcantara trim, Alcantara-upholstered knee pads, carbon fiber seatback covers for the M Sport seats, and an M Performance steering wheel. Carbon fiber shift paddles and door sill plates are offered as well. None of the M Performance parts increase the engine\'s output, so enthusiasts who want to dial in more power will need to turn to the aftermarket. Stock, the M2 is powered by a twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter straight-six rated at 453 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque. The engine spins the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transmission, though an eight-speed automatic is offered at an extra cost. The aforementioned parts will be available to order when M2 deliveries begin in April 2023. Pricing hasn\'t been announced yet.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img'),(3,'Lexus recalls 4,200 NX crossovers due to missing welds','RONAN GLON','Fewer than 1% of the recalled units are missing spot-welds near the front shock mounts','Lexus is recalling about 4,200 units of the 2022 NX due to missing spot-welds. Announced in April 2022, the campaign includes the NX250, the NX350, the NX350h, and the NX450h+, and the Japanese company has asked its dealers to stop selling the vehicles in their inventory.Documents published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) explain that some spot-welds might have been missed during the production process. They\'re located around the mounting areas for the front shock absorbers. Leaving out these welds can cause some of the other welds and the surrounding panels to weaken or crack over time, which could in turn make it possible for the front shock absorbers to separate from their mounting area. This would increase the risk of a crash by causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. The recall includes 4,215 examples of the NX, though Lexus estimates that fewer than 1% of those are missing welds. It will begin notifying owners of potentially affected vehicles by mail on June 6, 2022. They\'ll be asked to take their NX to an authorized dealer so that a mechanic can check for missing welds. Lexus is still developing a solution to the problem. In the meantime, it has asked its dealers to stop selling the NXs potentially affected by the recall that are still in inventories across the nation, though as of writing only 12 units have been identified. Weld-related recalls are mercifully rare but not unheard of. In 2019, Subaru recalled 2,107 new Outback and Legacy models due to faulty welds below the cowl panel, and 293 units of the Ascent were recalled in 2018 because they were missing a series of spot welds on the B-pillar. At the time, the company explained that the 293 crossovers without the proper welds would be destroyed and replaced.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img'),(4,'2022 Audi RS 7 Exclusive Edition is limited to just 23 cars','ZAC PALMER','You\'ll pay $166,495 for this special version of the RS 7 Sportback','This is the 2022 Audi RS 7 Exclusive Edition, and it sure is exclusive. Audi says it’s only going to make 23 RS 7s in this spec, so if you’re into the rare, this could be the RS 7 to pursue.So, what do you get with the Exclusive Edition? The main draw is a unique Mamba Black pearl paint that presents as black with blue undertones. We suspect that the paint will speak for itself much better in person than these limited photos do. You also get Sepang Blue stitching throughout the interior. Those blue accents can be found on the door armrests, center console trim, upper door panels, upper dashboard, seats and floor mats. Audi says that various controls in the cabin are adorned in Sepang Blue braiding, too.Beyond the black paint and blue interior accents, this RS 7 comes decked out with virtually every performance option you can spec. That means it has the ceramic brake package (with blue-painted calipers), the Dynamic Ride Control suspension and the Sport Exhaust with black-finished exhaust tips. The 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 is the same, and it continues to output 591 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque.Audi makes both its Carbon Optic package and Black Optic package standard for the Exclusive Edition. This means it has blacked-out badges and trim, along with a carbon fiber spoiler, diffuser and mirror caps. It’s also fitted with 22-inch wheels wrapped in 285-section-width summer performance tires. Lastly, the interior gets the Audi Exclusive extended leather package that covers as many surfaces as possible in black leather.The starting price for the Exclusive Edition is $166,495. Again, only 23 will be produced in this spec, and Audi expects them to ship sometime in late summer.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img'),(5,'Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 runs naked in the snow','REESE COUNTS','This should be the fastest version of the 718 yet','It\'s been awhile since we\'ve seen pictures of the upcoming Porsche 718 Cayman GT4. Previous spy photos showed an rough prototype testing at the Nürburgring. In these new images, a far more polished car appears to be undergoing some winter testing. Most of the Porsche prototypes we see are nearly naked ( just look at this 718 Boxster Spyder), but this GT4 is more exposed than most. Don\'t expect too much to change before production.Like the last Cayman GT4, expect this new car to be the end-all-be-all of the 718 platform. If the wing didn\'t give it away, just look at the aggressive front splitter or at the snow-covered diffuser. This car isn\'t screwing around. Like the last GT4, the front bumper draws influence from the current 911 GT3. The only thing that looks missing is some additional bodywork around the side air intakes.Expect less weight and more power, though what rests at the heart has not yet been determined. Rumors continue to suggest that the GT4 will swap in a flat-six in place of the 718\'s turbo flat-four, but that\'s simply hope and speculation. What\'s almost a given is that the GT4 will retain a manual transmission.The car has been in development for a while, so don\'t expect to wait too much longer before the reveal. The Geneva Motor Show is coming up in just a few weeks, so we might get lucky there.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img'),(6,'Toyota Land Cruiser 300-series gets life-size Lego build','BEN HSU','It\'s comprised of 440,000 bricks and weighs 4,520 pounds.','Whenever a hot car debuts nowadays, the inevitable life-size Lego build follows soon after. Like Nürburgring lap times for supercars, it\'s practically an expected part of the vehicle launch routine. The latest vehicle to get the treatment is the not-for-America 300-series Toyota Land Cruiser. The build was commissioned by Al-Futtaim Motors, the exclusive Toyota importer for the the United Arab Emirates. According to a short video about the project, it took a team of 12 individuals 2,688 hours to complete the 1:1 scale sculpture. A total of 440,000 Lego bricks were used in the build, and the finished Cruiser weighs approximately 4,520 pounds, or about 1,000 lighter than the actual 5,600-pound truck. Everything, including the windows, tires and little Toyota oval logos found throughout the car, are made from Lego bricks. The headlights and taillights are even illuminated, backlit from some kind of interior light source. Built around a simple steel frame for rigidity, it measures about 195 inches long, 78 inches wide and 76 inches tall. In the shopping center where it\'s on display, a real 300-series Land Cruiser parks beside it. While the Land Cruiser isn\'t sold here, Toyota has promised us a Lexus LX 600 variant with all the off-road prowess the chassis promises. Under the hood will reside a twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 making 409 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque as its only engine option; the Cruiser\'s diesel and 4.0-liter naturally aspirated V6 aren\'t coming. In the rest of the world the 300-series has been well received as a proper evolution of Toyota\'s legendary off-roader, so hopefully that presages good things for the Lexus. The Land Cruiser follows in the fine tradition of other life-size Lego builds. Past unrelated projects have sprouted up all over the globe, and the plastic brick subject matter has included a Formula One car, Lamborghini Sian, Ferrari SF70H, Bugatti Chiron, Toyota Camry, McLaren Senna, Chevy Silverado Trail Boss and Toyota Supra.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img'),(7,'Next-gen Mercedes C 63 AMG to get plug-in hybrid four-cylinder','JONATHON RAMSEY','Tuned version of the 416-hp four-pot in the A 45 S with hybrid help and AWD','Autocar reports that the next-generation Mercedes-AMG C 63 will give up its membership to the V8 club and become a four-cylinder plug-in hybrid. You read that correctly. The news isn\'t exactly new, it only adds more confirmation to what\'s been whispered thrice before. In April 2018, Mercedes-AMG boss Tobias Möers told CarAdvice that Affalterbach\'s take on Mercedes\' bestselling sedan would go hybrid and all-wheel drive. He foreshadowed the four-cylinder sucker-punch by saying, \"[We] have to be creative, and I\'m chasing performance, and that\'s not strictly linked to the number of cylinders.\" In May this year, a German site specializing in Mercedes rumors predicted the four-cylinder hybrid with 476 horsepower in base trim and a 48-volt electrical architecture. Then, in another Möers interview piece at the Frankfurt Motor Show, Motor Trend mentioned the 416-hp 2.0-liter four-cylinder in the current A 45 S and CLA 45 S, and wrote, \"Expect to see a version powering a future 2021 Mercedes-Benz C-Class AMG model.\" The C-Class AMG got so good that it\'s been showing the segment superstar BMW M3/M4 how a sport sedan and coupe should be done, part of that master class coming via the sound and gravitas conveyed by the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8. The M177 AMG V8 makes 469 hp and 479 pound-feet of torque in standard trim, 503 hp and 516 lb-ft in S trim. No matter if the W206 C 63 AMG matches those numbers, or, more likely, exceeds them, plenty of AMG fans will be gutted by their champion falling two cylinders behind the next-gen M3 and adopting economy-car displacement specs.  Nevertheless, we\'re told the coming hot C will be the first use-case for the electrified 2.0-liter M139 four-cylinder in the C 63, and eventually the C 43 and all AMG GLC variants; today\'s C 43 employs the M276 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6. They\'ll pull the 48-volt integrated starter motor hooked up to the M256 inline-six cylinder in the CLS 53 AMG that can supply an additional 22 hp and 184 lb-ft. Tuning for the coming C 63 AMG will draw more horsepower from the electric motor, though, and get a larger capacity battery as well as more comprehensive energy recuperation. The nine-speed AMG MCT Speedshift automatic is expected to handle shifting duty. If that German site is correct about a base model with 476 hp, that would add seven horses compared to the current car. Autocar says the top trim \"will match\" the current S trim\'s 503 hp, while upping torque to 553 lb-ft. Even with the same or slightly elevated numbers, dynamic benefits would come from less weight over the front axle and a powertrain with better front-rear balance. All-wheel drive will be a non-negotiable option, but one using the same rear-bias adjustability found in the current E 63 AMG. As for bodystyles, Autocar says the full-fat wagon will retire, leaving just sedan, coupe and convertible styles for the C 63 AMG, the wagon only available in C 43 AMG trim. We\'ve about two years to wait, with the series production redesigned C-Class due next year as a 2021 model, the AMG versions following the year after.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img'),(8,'2023 Bentley Bentayga EWB Azure First Edition on sale for one year','JONATHON RAMSEY','Diamond illumination, exclusive wheels, and badges come standard','The 2023 Bentley Bentayga EWB has added a third flavor. Above the standard spec, the Azure trim adds distinguishing features like elongated quilting and perforation on the numerous leather surfaces, jeweled caps for the fuel and oil fillers, fancier wheels, and Azure badging. For the first model year of production the craftspeople at Crewe will build an Azure First Edition trim. The First Edition makes normally optional frills like Bentley Diamond Illumination and the Naim for Bentley stereo standard equipment. That stereo pumps 1,720 watts of playlist through 20 speakers. There are also a heated steering wheel, folding picnic tables, and additional driver assistance systems  The cabin is sewn up with exclusive contrast stitching and embroidery, and of course there\'s First Edition badging outside, on the C-pillar, and inside on the seats. Should the customer decide that isn\'t enough advertising, buyers can request handcrafted metal overlays. This version of the SUV shows off brighter grilles in the lower bumper and sits on 22-inch, 10-spoke, directional wheels, an inch larger than the hoops on the standard Bentayga.  The Bentayga EWB marks the return of the Azure name for the first time since 2010, and the Bentayga\'s second First Edition after the 2017 Bentayga W12 which was limited to 608 units. The W12, by the way, is said to be forbidden to the EWB. Pricing hasn\'t been announced, but since the EWB starts at around $230,000 and Bentley\'s already said it expects \"that people will option them beyond $300,000,\" the Azure First Edition can be expected to push that well higher.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img');
