A longtime insider on Bimmerpost reports the same news, that the model codenamed G46 \"may have been cancelled.\" And checking the Automotive News future product pipeline returns this, \"Production of the U.S.-made model could end in late 2025 with no replacement planned, according to AutoForecast Solutions.\"','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img','Supposedly, the original plan was for the clamshell crossover to mimic the split headed to the 3 Series lineup, with an ICE-powered 3 Series range on an evolution of BMW\'s Cluster Architecture (CLAR), and pure-electric variants of the 3\'er on the coming Neue Klasse architecture developed just for EVs. For the 3 Series, the electric sedan could resurrect the i3 name, the electric crossover would be the iX3.','The iX4 remains on track. BMW Blog suspects the automaker\'s accountants couldn\'t justify the spend on a new version of the gas-powered X4, though. The raw sales data we see isn\'t sufficient to make judgements. X4 sales have been climbing in the states, reaching 10,620 units in the U.S. last year, and 33% more than that in Europe. The X3 sold about 156,000 units in the U.S. and Europe last year compared to the X4\'s roughly 26,000. At the beginning of this year we heard that BMW could eliminate the 4 Series and 8 Series for a reborn 6 Series lineup. So in addition to the massive expense of electrification forcing ruthless decisions, there are clearly other, larger ideas in play.','The first Neue Klasse model is due in 2025, presumed to be the new i3 and iX3. The iX4 is anticipated the following year. They will take advantage of BMW\'s Gen6 batteries with cylindrical cells that are less expensive to produce and create fewer carbon emissions in production, increase vehicle range by 30% compared to BMW\'s current prismatic cells, weigh up to 20% less, and raise charging speeds to 270 kW. ','If the supplier source who spoke to Inside EVs can be believed, we won\'t need to wait for 2025 for more big X4 news. The supplier said it would be providing parts for two new electric crossovers with quad-motor setups. One would be an iX3, the other an iX4, the supplier adding that \"other code designations\" suggest these could be proper M versions of standard electric crossovers. Curioser and curioser.'),(2,'2023 BMW M2 gets full range of M Performance parts','RONAN GLON','The catalog includes body kits, wheels, and suspension parts','Unveiled in October 2022, the new 2023 BMW M2 is already eligible to receive a wide selection of factory-developed M Performance parts. The list of add-ons announced by the Munich-based carmaker includes carbon fiber trim, forged wheels, and a lighter exhaust system.BMW M leveraged its five decades of racing experience to give future M2 owners numerous customization options. Starting with the outside, the company designed a carbon fiber body kit that includes a front splitter, inserts for the front air intakes, side skirts, a rear spoiler, and a rear diffuser. M Performance titanium and carbon fiber exhaust tips and a red M-branded tow strap add a finishing touch to the look.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img','Speaking of the exhaust, BMW M created a system that consists of stainless-steel front pipes and a titanium rear section. It weighs over 17 pounds less than the stock setup and includes electronically-controlled flaps. BMW promises it unlocks \"distinct, racing car acoustics.\"','Handling is one of BMW M\'s claims to fame, and the M Performance suspension system was designed to make the new M2 even sharper to drive on and off the track. It adds height-adjustable spring cups to the front and rear axles that let drivers lower the ride height by nearly half an inch. These parts can be paired with 20-inch front and 21-inch rear forged wheels available in M Frozen Gold Bronze or M Jet Black.Buyers who want an M-themed interior can add carbon fiber and Alcantara trim, Alcantara-upholstered knee pads, carbon fiber seatback covers for the M Sport seats, and an M Performance steering wheel. Carbon fiber shift paddles and door sill plates are offered as well.','None of the M Performance parts increase the engine\'s output, so enthusiasts who want to dial in more power will need to turn to the aftermarket. Stock, the M2 is powered by a twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter straight-six rated at 453 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque. The engine spins the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transmission, though an eight-speed automatic is offered at an extra cost.','The aforementioned parts will be available to order when M2 deliveries begin in April 2023. Pricing hasn\'t been announced yet.'),(3,'Apple lends prestige to a new Mercedes-Benz music system','Stephen Williams','The high-end package, with 31 loudspeakers, features Apple Music\'s Spatial Audio','Not often does Apple offer its name to products or technologies that emerge from beyond the walls of Fortress Cupertino. Could a partnership with Mercedes-Benz signal the start of something new?','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img','Mercedes’ new audio system unveiled this past weekend centers on the integration of Apple Music’s Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos surround — a music enhancement generally heard in headphone-listening environments — in selected (and optional) Burmester audio systems. Plans are to offer the components initially in the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, the S-Class as well as the EQE, EQE SUV, EQS and EQS SUV. No prices for the options were announced.','Also partnering in the project is the Universal Music Group, one of the world’s leading music publishers.According to Mercedes, the Dolby tech “empowers musicians and audio engineers to place discrete audio elements or objects in a three-dimensional sound field, which goes beyond the capabilities of standard stereo productions. The system adapts to any playback environment, meaning fans can listen to music with unparalleled clarity that matches the artist\'s original vision in the studio.”','We would expect no less from 31 speakers in a Maybach, powered by a pair of amps churning out 1,750 watts. Imagine Keith Richards cranking guitar through 31 speakers in an enclosed car cockpit.Almost three out of four music consumers say that they listen mostly in a car, says Mercedes Chairman Ola Källenius. ”Through this exceptional partnership, we are giving our customers the extraordinary in-car audio experience they expect from Mercedes-Benz,” he said. “Both Apple and UMG share our vision and values and, together with Dolby, we will create a seamless and unique experience for our customers.\"','Partnerships between automakers and audio companies have become common in recent years, and there have been mixed results from systems attempting to create a \"surround sound\" experience that goes beyond stereo. Bose put its systems into General Motors cars decades ago, and others followed, including Bowers & Wilkins, JBL and even the legendary McIntosh. Most recently, famed Italian speaker designer Sonon faber found a home in Maserati\'s new Grecale, and British speaker maker KEF is working with Lotus.'),(4,'It\'s powered by a production-based Coyote V8 engine','ZAC PALMER','2024 Ford Mustang dons a racing suit for Australia\'s Supercars series','Ford announced six track-bound variants of the 2024 Mustang developed for a wide range of series, but that\'s not all the Blue Oval has up its sleeve. It unveiled a racing-ready model online that was designed to compete in Australia\'s popular Supercars series starting in 2023.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img','Introduced at the Mount Panorama track in New South Wales, the first racing version of the seventh-generation Mustang was developed by Ford Performance and homologation team Dick Johnson Racing. It complies with the Gen3 regulations that will come into effect in 2023, so it\'s relatively close to the street-legal model in terms of overall design. It nonetheless gains a full body kit that includes a front splitter, side skirts, a massive rear spoiler and a wide air diffuser, and it rides on 18-inch center-locking wheels wrapped by Dunlop Sport Maxx tires.','The resemblance is only skin-deep. Engineers used carbon fiber extensively to keep weight in check and stripped the production car\'s interior. They then added a full roll cage, a racing seat, a quick-release steering wheel and a digital instrument cluster, among other parts.','Ford hasn\'t released much in the way of technical specifications. It claims that power comes from a \"production-based\" Coyote V8 engine, though a peek under the hood reveals numerous modifications including a carbon fiber air intake system and aluminum radiator. And, the engine exhales through a new exhaust system that features a pair of cool-looking outlets that poke through the driver-side side skirt.','Australian enthusiasts will get the chance to see the Mustang in action for the first time during the 2022 Bathurst 1000. The coupe won\'t participate in the race; it will hit the track for a couple of demonstration laps. Its competition debut is scheduled for 2023. The list of teams that will race it include Dick Johnson Racing, Tickford Racing, Grove Racing, Blanchard Racing Team and Walkinshaw Andretti United.'),(5,'Honda Prologue electric SUV previewed with first official photo','REESE COUNTS','Here\'s the first Honda EV to come from its collaboration with GM','Honda has talked about its EV collaboration with GM for a long while now, but today we finally get our first glimpse of something physical to come from it. And by physical, we mean a computer rendering.This is the first official photo of the Honda Prologue, which Honda intends to launch in 2024. When it comes to seeing Honda products before they are officially launched in prototype or production form, this is a rather early sneak peek — Honda tends to keep its products close to its vest. Unfortunately, the single photo of the Prologue you’re looking at here is the meat of the news today. But even left at that, it allows us a neat little preview of this SUV.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img','The Prologue is the result of a collaboration between designers in Honda’s Los Angeles design studio and back in Japan. Conceptually, the idea was to make an SUV that looked modern and fresh, but also looks comfortable in a showroom of existing Honda vehicles. Honda says that aerodynamics were a huge focus of the project, because better aero means more range and reduced cabin wind noise. As a result, Honda says it ended up with simple, clean surfaces for its body lines.',' “As the project leader for the exterior design of the Honda Prologue, it was very exciting to work with a young team of designers with new capabilities to create an SUV with clean, simple lines and a strong influence from our global EV models, including the Honda E,” said Jiro Ikeda, exterior design leader. “We balanced that with a neo-rugged look that you see in our current lineup, to ensure Prologue represents a true Honda EV.”','You’ll notice in the single photo that the Prologue has a long wheelbase, short front overhang and meaty-looking tires. There’s an opening for air to pass through the lower portion of the bumper, but there’s no dramatic grille. It has a relatively narrow black band of a shield that runs across the front of the car, and this piece contains both the headlights on the edges and the Honda logo front and center. Lots of black-painted accents all over give this silver car a classy and eye-catching two-tone look, and the oversize wheels are drawing a lot of attention to themselves in this photo. Lastly, we’ll point out that the charging port is prominently placed in the front fender.In Honda’s presentation to media, it said that the first priority for Prologue sales will be Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) states, but expect it to roll it out elsewhere soon after. Honda didn’t say exactly where it will produce the Prologue yet, but says it will be able to assemble the vehicle in its own facilities. Following the launch of the Prologue, Honda says the first EVs built on its own in-house Honda e:Architecture will arrive in 2026.','To support the Prologue and future EVs, Honda says it’s going to be installing Level 2 and fast-charging stations in dealerships across the country. Honda also showed us a few photos of a new design language for dealers, below. The white and blue color scheme remains, but the building itself looks far more modern and futuristic than Honda’s current dealers. Before all you eagle-eyed commenters point it out in the pictures, yes, we also see the Euro market Honda HR-V/Japan market Honda Vezel in the photos of a U.S.-intent dealership.'),(6,'Toyota Land Cruiser 300-series gets life-size Lego build','BEN HSU','It\'s comprised of 440,000 bricks and weighs 4,520 pounds.','Whenever a hot car debuts nowadays, the inevitable life-size Lego build follows soon after. Like Nürburgring lap times for supercars, it\'s practically an expected part of the vehicle launch routine. The latest vehicle to get the treatment is the not-for-America 300-series Toyota Land Cruiser. The build was commissioned by Al-Futtaim Motors, the exclusive Toyota importer for the the United Arab Emirates.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img','According to a short video about the project, it took a team of 12 individuals 2,688 hours to complete the 1:1 scale sculpture. A total of 440,000 Lego bricks were used in the build, and the finished Cruiser weighs approximately 4,520 pounds, or about 1,000 lighter than the actual 5,600-pound truck. Everything, including the windows, tires and little Toyota oval logos found throughout the car, are made from Lego bricks. The headlights and taillights are even illuminated, backlit from some kind of interior light source. Built around a simple steel frame for rigidity, it measures about 195 inches long, 78 inches wide and 76 inches tall.','In the shopping center where it\'s on display, a real 300-series Land Cruiser parks beside it. While the Land Cruiser isn\'t sold here, Toyota has promised us a Lexus LX 600 variant with all the off-road prowess the chassis promises. Under the hood will reside a twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 making 409 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque as its only engine option; the Cruiser\'s diesel and 4.0-liter naturally aspirated V6 aren\'t coming. ','In the rest of the world the 300-series has been well received as a proper evolution of Toyota\'s legendary off-roader, so hopefully that presages good things for the Lexus. The Land Cruiser follows in the fine tradition of other life-size Lego builds. Past unrelated projects have sprouted up all over the globe, and the plastic brick subject matter has included a Formula One car, Lamborghini Sian, Ferrari SF70H, Bugatti Chiron, Toyota Camry, McLaren Senna, Chevy Silverado Trail Boss and Toyota Supra.',NULL),(7,'2024 Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E Performance makes 671 horsepower','JONATHON RAMSEY','Plug-in hybrid has the most powerful four-cylinder ever produced','The V8-powered Mercedes-AMG C 63 is going away, and that\'s definitely sad. But to make up for it, the 2024 Mercedes-AMG C 63 S E Performance is offering a lot more power. The turbocharged, plug-in hybrid four-cylinder now makes a combined output of 671 horsepower and 752 pound-feet of torque. Those are increases of 168 horsepower and 236 pound-feet of torque.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img','Making this power is a combination of the highest-output M139l engine yet and a rear-mounted electric motor with a two-speed transmission. The engine, while similar to what\'s used in the C 43, gets a bigger version of the electrically-assisted turbo to make 469 horsepower and 402 pound-feet of torque, making it the most potent four-cylinder in the world. That engine sends power through a nine-speed automatic to the rear axle where the electric motor is. The electric motor makes 201 horsepower and has a two-speed transmission itself, which changes gear around 87 mph. The electric motor also features an electronically-controlled limited-slip differential. Power can be sent either to the rear wheels or back up to the front, enabling all-wheel drive in gas, hybrid or electric driving scenarios. The all-wheel drive system does have a drift mode, like other AMG models. Performance is impressive with a claimed 3.3-second time to hit 60 mph, and top speed of 174 mph (standard top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph).','The C 63 S E Performance is a plug-in hybrid, but just barely. It has the same 6.1-kWh capacity as the AMG GT 63 S E Performance 4-Door. In that model, it provides just 7 miles of range. The C 63\'s smaller size might get it a little more range, but likely very little. The battery weighs 196 pounds and features liquid cooling, with coolant running between every single cell. The battery will also power the C 63 to 81 mph without the engine kicking in.Naturally, AMG made chassis upgrades, too. The suspension uses steel springs with electronically adjustable shocks. Four-wheel steering is standard, as are steel brakes with six-piston calipers up front and single-piston units at the rear. Interestingly, the C 63 S is 3.3 inches longer overall compared to a regular C-Class sedan, and its wheelbase is longer by 0.4 inch. Width is also 3 inches greater. Wheels are 19 inches as standard, but 20-inch wheels are available as options.','And of course, the C 63 S E Performance looks meaner, too, with a redesigned front fascia, new hood vent, side skirts, rear bumper with diffuser and a rear spoiler. The interior gets AMG-specific trim and sport seats, with even more aggressive seats available optionally. New display readouts are included, too for the car\'s hybrid functions. Pricing and availability of this hot C-Class have not yet been announced. With a model year of 2024, we would expect it to launch sometime in the coming year.',NULL),(8,'It\'s a sedan inspired by a van inspired by a spaceship','JONATHON RAMSEY','2023 Hyundai Grandeur (Azera) revealed with futuristic makeover for overseas markets','Hyundai\'s American division deep-sixed the Azera after the 2017 model year, but the big sedan lives on in several overseas markets. Known as the Grandeur in some countries, including its home market of Korea, it enters its seventh generation with a futuristic exterior design that will leave no one indifferent.','2022-11-02 07:02:56','img','Up front, the new Azera borrows styling cues from the head-turning Staria introduced in 2021 — a sedan influenced by a van inspired by a spaceship is admittedly a difficult plot to follow, but bear with us. The front end is relatively low and flat, and it\'s characterized by a massive grille flanked by a pair of rectangular headlights. The thin LED strip above the grille accentuates the Azera\'s width and illustrates Hyundai\'s Seamless Horizon design language. Out back, this approach to design brings an elegant curved trunk lid and a second strip of LEDs.','Designers bucked the \"four-door coupe\" trend and gave the Azera a relatively upright roof line that clears up a generous amount of interior space. The sheet metal begins to slope towards the trunk above the rear wheels, and this created space for a third side window. Hyundai notes that this feature is a tribute to the original Grandeur, which made its debut in 1986 as a badge-engineered Mitsubishi Debonair.','The cabin reflects Hyundai\'s ongoing upmarket shift, both in terms of the materials used and in terms of technology. The driver faces a steering wheel inspired by the one fitted to the original Grandeur and a digital instrument cluster connected to the infotainment system\'s touchscreen. Look closely and you\'ll spot some cool design details: South Korea\'s approach to design notably inspired the pattern on the door panels. Real wood trim, aluminum accents, and naturally-dyed leather upholstery add a finishing touch to the upscale look and feel.','Hyundai hasn\'t released technical specifications, though we\'re guessing the engine palette will include four- and six-cylinder units. Front-wheel drive will come standard, and all-wheel drive will likely be offered at an extra cost in some markets. More details about the 2023 Hyundai Azera will emerge in the coming months and deliveries are scheduled to start in the second half of 2023 — but not in the United States. Nothing suggests the Azera will make a comeback here, where crossovers and SUVs represent the bulk of Hyundai\'s sales.');
