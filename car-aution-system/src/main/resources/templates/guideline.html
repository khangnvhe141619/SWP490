        <h3>What is a Vickrey Auction?</h3>
        <p>A Vickrey auction is a sealed-bid auction where bidders submit bids without knowing the bids of other people.
            However, as opposed to other sealed-bid auctions, the price paid is the second-highest bid price and not the
            winning bid price. The Vickrey auction was named after William Vickrey, a Canadian who won the 1996 Nobel
            Prize in Economics for his research on asymmetric information in economics.</p>
        <img src="assets/img/auction.png">
        <h3>Understanding a Vickrey Auction</h3>
        <p>In a Vickrey auction, the individual is bidding their true value and are not trying to assess what everyone
            else is going to bid. Therefore, in a Vickrey auction, the individual is bidding the maximum amount they are
            willing to pay and are not disadvantaged by it.</p>
        <p>By utilizing the second-price mechanism in a Vickrey auction, individuals bid truthfully â€“ individuals are
            motivated to bid their maximum value because the individual understands that if their bid wins, they will
            only need to pay the second-highest bid value.</p>
        <p>For example, consider an auction for an antique that an individual places a $100 value on.</p>
        <p>The individual would not post a higher bid than the maximum value ($100) he has established for the antique
            due to the possibility of having to pay a price higher than his maximum willingness to pay of $100.</p>

        <h3>Acceptance of condition - buyer inspection/preview</h3>
        <p>Vehicles and equipment often display significant wear and tear. Assets are sold AS IS with no
            warranty, express or implied, and we highly recommend previewing them before bidding. The
            preview
            period is the only opportunity to inspect an asset to verify condition and suitability. No
            refunds,
            adjustments or returns will be entertained.</p>
