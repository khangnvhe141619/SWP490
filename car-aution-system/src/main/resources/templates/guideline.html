        <h3>What is a Vickrey Auction?</h3>
        <p>A Vickrey auction is a sealed-bid auction where bidders submit bids without knowing the bids of other people.
            However, as opposed to other sealed-bid auctions, the price paid is the second-highest bid price and not the
            winning bid price. The Vickrey auction was named after William Vickrey, a Canadian who won the 1996 Nobel
            Prize in Economics for his research on asymmetric information in economics.</p>
        <img src="assets/img/auction.png">
        <h3>Understanding a Vickrey Auction</h3>
        <p>In a Vickrey auction, the individual is bidding their true value and are not trying to assess what everyone
            else is going to bid. Therefore, in a Vickrey auction, the individual is bidding the maximum amount they are
            willing to pay and are not disadvantaged by it.</p>
        <p>By utilizing the second-price mechanism in a Vickrey auction, individuals bid truthfully – individuals are
            motivated to bid their maximum value because the individual understands that if their bid wins, they will
            only need to pay the second-highest bid value.</p>
        <p>For example, consider an auction for an antique that an individual places a $100 value on.</p>
        <p>The individual would not post a higher bid than the maximum value ($100) he has established for the antique
            due to the possibility of having to pay a price higher than his maximum willingness to pay of $100.</p>
