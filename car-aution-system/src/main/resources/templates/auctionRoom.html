                                            -------
                                            Là một trong những tài năng hiếm có của CLB Liverpool, Sadio Mané hiện
                                            đang
                                            sở hữu số dư tài khoản mỗi tháng khoảng 852.000 USD/tháng (tương đương
                                            19,5
                                            tỷ VNĐ). Tuy đây chỉ là mức lương thuộc hàng khá ở giải ngoại hạng Anh,
                                            nhưng cũng là con số nhiều người "mơ cũng không thấy".
                                            Việc nhận mức lương khủng khiến nhiều người nghĩ rằng, ngôi sao này sẽ
                                            sống
                                            trong "nhung lụa", hàng hiệu đắt tiền chắc chắn là thứ không thể thiếu.
                                            Tuy
                                            nhiên, tiền đạo này lại rất khác biệt.
                                            Dân mạng đã liên tục truyền tay nhau về bức hình anh chàng này đi dạo
                                            phố,
                                            điểm đặc biệt là chiếc điện thoại Sadio Mané đang cầm trên tay.
                                            Người hâm mộ nhanh chóng nhận ra và khá bất ngờ khi ngôi sao tiền tỷ của
                                            Liverpool đang dùng chiếc iPhone đời cũ bị vỡ nát màn hình, và thay vì
                                            dùng
                                            chiếc AirPods sang chảnh như người khác, Sadio Mané vẫn còn đeo tai nghe
                                            cũ
                                            có dây rợ ngoằn ngoèo.
                                            Vậy, với 19,5 tỷ mỗi tháng, anh chàng này "để đâu cho hết"? Và đây là
                                            câu
                                            trả lời của anh:
                                            "Tại sao tôi phải có 10 chiếc Ferrari, 20 chiếc đồng hồ nạm kim cương
                                            hoặc
                                            vài chiếc máy bay? Những thứ xa hoa phù phiếm đâu có làm tôi vui vẻ hơn.
                                            Nhiều năm về trước, gia đình tôi luôn trong cảnh thiếu ăn. Tôi từng phải
                                            làm
                                            việc ngoài cánh đồng để phụ giúp cha mẹ. Mặc dù không được học hành đầy
                                            đủ,
                                            nhưng nhờ bóng đá, giờ đây tôi đã có thể giúp đồng bào của mình.
                                            Tôi đã xây trường học, sân vận động, mang đến quần áo, giày dép, thức
                                            ăn.
                                            Thêm vào đó, tôi cũng chu cấp 70 euro (khoảng 1,8 triệu VND) mỗi tháng
                                            cho
                                            những người dân ở những khu vực đói khổ nhất tại Senegal để trang trải
                                            cuộc
                                            sống cho gia đình họ" 🥰
                                            Mới đây nhất, Sadio Mané đã chi ra nửa triệu USD để xây dựng bệnh xá và
                                            trường học tại Bambali. Đây là làng quê nghèo, nơi ngôi sao Liverpool
